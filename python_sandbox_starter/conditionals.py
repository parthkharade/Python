# Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) - Used to compare values



# Logical operators (and, or, not) - Used to combine conditional statements




# Membership Operators (in, not in) - Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
if(3 in numbers):
    print('3 in numbers')


# Identity Operators (is, is not) - Compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

if (x is y):
     print(x is y)
